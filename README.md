# Quickserve

## Description
QuickServe is a remote-pay and instant-pick food ordering system designed for college canteens.
The main problem in the SJEC canteen is not cooking time — it is the double queue.
Students first wait to pay at the billing counter and then wait again at the serving counter while staff manually verify paper bills. This wastes most of the short break time and creates unnecessary congestion.
QuickServe removes the billing counter from the flow entirely.
Students order and pay from their phones, receive a secure digital token, and directly collect their food from the serving counter.
The kitchen staff sees paid orders in real time on a dashboard and marks them as served.
This makes food pickup fast, clean, and organized.
